- Supports multiple instruments including futures and options.

## Requirements

To run the algorithmic trading strategy, you need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Zerodha Kite Connect API credentials
- Enable TOTP verification in your kite account
- Required Python packages (specified in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

## Usage

1. Set up your Zerodha Kite Connect API credentials from https://kite.trade/
2. Enable TOTP verification for your kite account
3. After setting up the environment, run setup.py (do this just once)
4. Every day before the market starts, run access_tokens.py and premarket.py 
5. Run strategy.ipynb to initiate the strategy.


## Configuration

 `config.py`:
- Contains configuration settings such as API keys, account credentials.
 `utils.py`:
- Contains helper functions to place and modify orders, place gtt orders, calculate technical indicators such as bollinger bands and Volume Weighted Average Price.
- It also has functions to fetch historical data and perform error handling.
- While the helper functions are using the Kite Connect's python client, the main strategy code has been written in a way that one can switch to another platform's API with minimal changes.
 `access_tokens.py`:
- This script uses Selenium to automate the process of logging into the account of kite and fetching the access_tokens for multiple accounts.

## Documentation

- Detailed documentation on the implementation of the trading strategy and usage instructions can be found in the `docs` directory.
