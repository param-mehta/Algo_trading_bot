## Guide

 `config.py`:
- Contains configuration settings such as API keys, account credentials.

`utils.py`:
- Contains helper functions to place and modify orders, place gtt orders, calculate technical indicators such as bollinger bands and Volume Weighted Average Price.
- It also has functions to fetch historical data and perform error handling.
- While the helper functions are using the Kite Connect's python client, the main strategy code has been written in a way that one can switch to another platform's API with minimal changes.

`access_tokens.py`:
- This script uses Selenium to automate the process of logging into the account of kite and fetching the access_tokens for multiple accounts.

`access_tokens.py`:
- The script would stop when either the max no. of cycles is reached or when the trading session concludes.
